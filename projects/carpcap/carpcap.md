# Thesis
## Move Based Ecosystems
#### The introduction of non-facebook MOVE ecosystems is the beginning of the next chapter. These ecosystems (Aptos, Sui, Linera (and now Solana)) have and will continue to onboard massive amounts of users and developers to MOVE based ecosystems, and enable cross chain deployments of protocols with only minor changes. Developers also have the ability to switch between these ecosystems freely as the market changes (no need to make bets on a certain ecosystem).

## PoW
#### PoW coins will remain the main store of value on the blockchain, but will not be the concensus layer for L1/Smart Contract blockchains. 
#### PoW is not dead, it's going through an evolution. PoW started in small scale, distributed networks of home computer, but soon evolved to ASIC mining. As ASIC's became more widely produced and powerful, a business model was constructed in which miners utilize warehouses to host fleets of miners in order to increase earnings potential, and this came with two key issues (Environmental Impact and Centralization). Environmental Impact of PoW mining is being addressed in an iterative process as the world begins a spiral into energy insecurity. Solar mining turned into wind farm mining turned into hydroelectic mining. These are nessicary and drastic improvemmts, but the future of "Green ASIC Mining" depends on the success of capturing flaring in west Texas. Centralization of PoW hashpower is a huge risk for 51% attacks, but there is no current best alternaive. PoW will split in two: specalized ecosystems with a niche community (TARI), and Store of Value ecosystems (BTC,ZCASH,IRON).

## DeWi
#### DeWi is extremely disruptive and has a huge growth potential in the next 10-20 years, but is limited by its mainstream adoption curve and lack of care for data sovereignty.

## Modularity and Interoperability
#### Winners in the L0/L1/L2 will be those with complete interoperability and modularity. ex. Solana integration with MoveVM, EVM and introduction of the Sealevel VM combined with urbit EVM and UVM integrations. Celestia, Polygon, Fuel Labs are pioneering modularity in blockchain stacks. Solana, Polygon and Cosmos (tendermint). Will outperform competitors who choose to specialize on-chain functionality (ETH, MINA, etc).
