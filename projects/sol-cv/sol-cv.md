# solana-business-cards
Basically a platform for Solana ecosystem participants to create a personal business card that stores social contact data (Backpack username, Dialect Username, Twitter, Discord, .sol address etc) and connects it into a central business card. These cards would be stored in a Backpack app (react native) that would serve as a list of contacts who's business card you have collected, and allow you to send your business card to any address on the Solana blockchain. 

## Questions: 
* Soulbound? 
* Do these actually need to be on chain, or just associated with a wallet address? (i.e. Dialect Accounts) 
* How to monotize?
