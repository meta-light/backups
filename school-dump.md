Now that we've gotten started and a quick introduction to the plans for the class, it's time to get our hands dirty and start playing with some of the key technologies within the space. For this week, we dive into the most important and first touch point for most users in the space, blockchain wallets and browsers. Wallets act as our persona, usernames, accounts, and access to the Web3 space in our current environment. Additionally, specific browsers or browser plugins are required for interacting with many decentralized applications which leverage the blockchain wallets of users. The following video providers a brief introduction to the content for this week, your goals, and how you should approach this week.

Required Video: Ropsten and Polygon Test Networks
Before getting started on the tutorial videos below and your assignments for this week, take a few minutes to review this video which discusses the Ropsten and Polygon Mumbai test networks that we will be using this semester. The Ropsten network was deprecated in August and will be sunset in Q4 2022, therefore we will need to transition our work to the Polygon network in the meantime. In the tutorials and book discussion they speak entirely of the Ropsten network as that was the primary test network for many years, however we now have many alternatives that we can use for development and how to get set up on them takes a few more steps outlined here.
The following link provides a general overview of how to get setup and connected to Poylgon: Polygon Setup

Required Video: MetaMask Installation and Use
Required Video: MetaMask Installation and Use
In this video tutorial, I provide an overview of how to install MetaMask in our environment, create a series of accounts, request and send Ether between accounts, deploy a smart contract in Remix, and use MetaMask inside of Remix to deploy to the live test network. This will be the initial stack of technologies we will be using to start our development, specifically the use of a "Wallet" and the use of a browser-based IDE via Remix to begin testing on both a local network and a live test network. Please start with this tutorial before starting the assignment so that you can ensure you can get the system configured as necessary. 

MetaMaskIntro - University of Arkansas MediaSpace

Note: In this recording, we were using the Ropsten network, this network is now deprecated and we will be using alternative networks and test networks. The format is the same, a "faucet" will provide you test tokens for the network. For this semester we will instead be using the Polygon Mumbai Test network and the Ethereum Goerli Test network. For instructions on getting access to these specific networks see the following link: https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/get-matic-on-polygon-mumbai-testnet-faucet/ Please use this instructions to replace the "ropsten" instructions at 11:00 in the video.
Optional Install Video(s): MetaMask Ethereum Wallet
Optional Install Video(s): MetaMask Ethereum Wallet
This semester you will be exploring the use of various hardware, software, and mobile wallets for use on the blockchain to determine the entry points for users. One that is quite popular and integrated with a plugin in chrome and other browsers is MetaMask. For a quick overview of MetaMask and a location for where to install this into your own personal browser, see the two links below. I recommend that you install this plugin on your own computer so that you can interact with various DAPPs on the Internet and retain the security of your keys on YOUR computer and not the school's hosted VMWare instance.

We will be working through the entirety of this book over the semester as we progress through the various technologies and interfaces needed for development within the public blockchain environment.

For this week, you will focus on the second and third chapters of the book which explores wallets and accounts in the Ethereum test network. Follow along with this chapter to get an exploration of how to interact with Ethereum through different technologies both installed on your computer or through a browser. As you follow along, you do not have to install all of the software that is described as some of them are quite large and configuration takes awhile (we will eventually get to them but the above tutorial installing MetaMask and using Remix should get you the abilities to test the sample code). However, follow through the chapter to understand the general steps and procedures, then refer to this week's assignments to determine which software you should install to complete the tasks, and return to this chapter for reference of how to complete various steps.

Required Videos and Software: Brave Browser
This week we will focus on each of you exploring some of the most useful and easy to enter blockchain applications, the Brave Browser. The Brave Browser is a fork of the Google Chrome browser (the most popular browser at the moment) that includes (a) a great ad blocker that tracks all the time and ads blocked, (b) a built-in cryptocurrency wallet (Uphold wallet) as well as the ability to install MetaMask (the same Chrome plugin), and (c) a way to get paid for your usual browsing on the Internet via the Basic Attention Token (BAT).

Assignment Steps (Please take screenshots and embed in a word document for submission):
1. Download and install Brave Browser.
2. Install the MetaMask wallet plugin to the Brave Browser.
3. Connect your MetaMask wallet account to the wallet in Brave by restoring from your seed phrase you saved.
4. Install the Uphold Wallet and setup an account so that you can receive your BAT tokens.
5. Use the Brave browser for a few days as your "primary" browser to see how well it compares to what you are using currently.
6. At the end of the week, submit your feedback on Microsoft Teams to the class with a paragraph describing what things you find (a) useful within the Brave Browser, (b) issues you may have found with the Brave Browser, and (c) any questions/comments on how the BAT tokens work.
Note: I've personally transitioned nearly all of my browser usage to Brave by importing the bookmarks and settings from Google Chrome which has been my primary browser for many years. The amount of ads reduced and the privacy provided by the browser has been incredible, no longer do you have to worry about Google or Facebook tracking you across all websites you visit on the internet because their cookies are blocked natively.

Now that you all have setup and configured your metamask accounts for various blockchains, funded them with some test tokens, and explored the Remix IDE a bit to deploy your first contract, it's time to actually UNDERSTAND what you did and what that contract was designed to do. This week will be focused on a series of workshop videos and tutorials to explain the syntax and functionality of Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum-based projects. There is no assignment this week, so find 4-5 hours this week to knock out some of the tutorial videos to get you ramped up to speed for next week when we start writing your OWN smart contracts.

To help everyone in the class get up to speed and on the same level, as some of you have not had a programming course in a few semesters (or ever), I am providing an overview workshop that I did a few semesters ago to onboard new users titled "Intro to Ethereum" workshop to provide a high-level overview of the entire stack of technologies needed for creating a blockchain project.This set of videos provides (a) an overview of what is Ethereum, how it is setup, how to get started developing, and some tips and tricks, then (b) a series of seperate video links for different components for developing on Ethereum. For some of you, this content may be something you have seen before, but having another perspective of it and a refresher will ensure that everyone is prepared better for the upcoming Hackathon this semester. Please work through the Workshop Video and then continue on to starting the seperate video links.
The workshop video presents my lecture, and the additional video links provide details on the Solidity language itself. Begin with the workshop video to get a deeper understanding of the Ethereum ecosystem, then proceed through the first 5 videos for this week.

For this semester, we are adopting a new textbook, "Building Ethereum DAPPS" by Roberto Infante, which provides a great overview of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, the system architectures, and a hands-on approach to developing a simple DAPP which includes the backend blockchain smart contracts, the JSON API integration, the user of WEB3.JS to interact with the Internet, and the development of a simple Web App to server as a user interface. We will be working through the entirety of this book over the semester as we progress through the various technologies and interfaces needed for development within the public blockchain environment.

For this week, you will focus on the 4th chapter of the book, Deploying your first smart contract, which explores using wallets and multiple accounts in the Ethereum test network to deploy the SimpleCoin smart contract in Remix. As your explore this chapter take notes of the various ways that you can directly interact with the blockchain through desktop wallets/clients such as geth, a desktop wallet like Ethereum Wallet, browser wallets like MetaMask, and cloud development IDEs such as Remix. As you follow along, you do not have the worry about transitioning accounts from the Ethereum Wallet described in Chapter 3 due to the issues with the Window's version of the wallet; instead, you can create all your accounts in MetaMask as described in the short video last week. All Solidity sample code in the book can be fully tested, deployed, and implemented using the Remix IDE or VS Code (which we will use in a few weeks) without any issues. Do not worry about installing a local development environment or the Ethereum Wallet (which is being deprecated) but instead understand the general purpose that these technologies serve. These wallets, IDEs, and development tools are continually being updated and incorporated into larger software so understanding their role is more important their deep functionality as the technology may be absorbed by another in a short time period (I've seen it multiple times just in the last 3 years...).

Optional Resource: OpenZeppelin Library of Contracts
Optional Resource: OpenZeppelin Library of Contracts
One of the biggest issues with developing a larger, more complex application in the blockchain space is having a nice set of pre-built, pre-tested, and pre-defined functions that can be utilized for development. Code reuse is one of the tenants of open-source software and software development in general for making more efficient use of a developer's time. For many years there was no general collective of "helper" functions that have been developed (e.g. math functions, string functions, data calculations, etc.) and required all developers to write even low-level functions to complete their applications. This lead to MANY different versions of the same function published to the Ethereum blockchain, taking up space, taking up resources, and lending to potential flaws in the security of the system when a function breaks. OpenZeppelin attempts to address that problem by creating open-source functions that any developer can use and feel comfortable knowing that it does exactly what it should, has been tested repeatedly, and is protected by the most up-to-date versions of the Solidity development techniques. As we progress throughout the semester we will try to use some of these functions in our applications to showcase the ability to build a library of reusable resources. Interestingly, this is also a great way to create a potential recurring revenue stream by creating a "Payable" function that requires money to run, and allowing other developers to use that as needed.

Required Reading: Bitcoin is Evolving!
Required Reading: Bitcoin is Evolving!
While the Ethereum platform has continued to evolve and add new features, the Bitcoin platform has remained fairly simple for over 10 years now. The downside to evolution is the introduction of new bugs, inability to handle scaling due to other types of transactions, and lack of clear community consensus for what to add. Recently the Bitcoin platform has been given the ability to write smart contracts using a platform called "Stacks". This is something to keep in your view for the coming year if bitcoin can incorporate additional smart contract functionality it will begin to pull some of the development away from other platforms as "the OG" continues to reign supreme.
The Stacks blockchain is a parallel blockchain to Bitcoin, and therefore runs as a Layer 1 chain, not a side-chain (the overview video describes this), but provides additional abilities with smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin Smart Contract Framework: https://www.stacks.co/ 
Stacks Overview Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkNwWSjYO6Q

Additionally, the Bitcoin developers have solved much of the scalibility issues with Bitcoin by introducing the Lightning Network a few years ago. The Lightning Network is a sub-layer of the Bitcoin protocol that allows for local networks to run transactions and then "batch" load them back to the main chain. This is very similar to how the Polygon network applies its updates to the Ethereum network. As El Salvador introduced Bitcoin as their currency, they had to implement the Lightning Network to solve this problem. The increased use of the networks has allowed the Lightning Network develops to continue to increase their features over the last year (2021).

What is the Lightning Network? (Whiteboardcrypto) Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXT9iq__V8c 
Finally, a recent upgrade called "TapRoot" provides Bitcoin the ability to provide privacy-enabled transactions that has the potential to completely change the view that individuals have on the Bitcoin network. One of the largest concerns with Bitcoin is the lack of privacy for each transaction. In other words, should we have to let the entire world know when we spend any of our money, what we spend the money on, and who else received the money? For most larger transactions we could say "yes" because of potential fraud, but the vast majority of our use of "currency" in our day-to-day lives is for things that are immaterial in the most part. If this continues to grow, it could cause some issues with regulation of the bitcoin network as well from a governmental perspective.

Required Reading: NFTs...the next "killer app" of blockchain technologies

Based on our uypcoming discussion regarding the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), I wanted to share a few links and readings for you to explore in preparation for discussing this content in Thursday's class. This area has EXPLODED within the past year and is being seen as one of the next big areas of investment oppotunity for blockchain applications. While 2017-2018 was known as the ICO boom, 2019 was the year of Stable Coins, 2020 was known as "DeFi Summer", 2021 became the year of NFTs. NFTs are just one unique application of blockchain technologies, but will serve as a foundational concept in our digital infrastructure for many decades to come. While many of these NFTs being bought and sold at the moment focus around either collectibles or digital game assets, it is quickly becoming a unique way for artists in many areas (e.g. music) to create and sell their assets with built in incentives to continue to provide income to the artist over time. Understanding the NFTs have been available since the early days of blockchain but just recently being leveraged for actual use-cases showcases the delay in learning about the technology by industry leaders.
Some of you may be eventually working on NFT projects, but others may also be working on verifications and certifications that can be held by a user (e.g. identity validation, hunting validation, etc.) that also may be created as NFTs to store permenantly on the blockchain as well. We will discuss how these are beintg used in different projects over the coming weeks.

Required Videos: ERC20 and ERC721 Standards
Required Videos: ERC20 and ERC721 Standards
One of the most important aspects of developing any open source application is understanding how to reuse existing code, especially standards, that allow a developer to focus on the new and "novel" aspects of their application while retaining a common interface for other applications in the ecosystem to interact with your code. Two standards that are utilized heavily in the current blockchain space are ERC20 (for tokens) and ERC721 (for NFTs) which each of you should be comfortable in creating, deploying, and interacting with in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the next few weeks we will be exploring the actual deployment of these aspects, starting by creating the contracts in Solidity and integrating them within a standard HTML application, and then exploring a series of new software developer kits (SDK) and tools created recently which have created an extremely ease-to-use and production ready environment for starting DAPPs and creating different tokens.
To start, please watch these two overviews of the ERC20 and ERC721 standards as presented by the Moralis team. These two videos provide a great overview of the standards and how they work. There is also a discussion of these ERC20 and ERC721 standards in the Ethereum book as well, but I find that a nice, quick video overview before re-reading the sections in the book help me grasp these concepts.

Required Video: An Introduction to IPFS
Required Video: An Introduction to IPFS
This video by Siraj (again, one of my favorite tech youtubers) discusses what the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is, how it will interact with our existing Internet architecture, as well as a short demo of the development. This is just one of the protocols being developed for decentralized file storage on the Internet and has significant implications on the approach we take to move away from centralized cloud storage and management.

Required Software: IPFS
Required Software: IPFS
To get a feel for the IPFS network and how it works (it really is quite easy and surprisingly reliable thus far), refer to the following video tutorial for a quick overview of how to interact with the Desktop system. There are a variety of YouTube tutorials for this so feel free to explore others, however many of them depict the command line interface for IPFS which would be used for a more production environment that is automated loading of items up to the network. As a storage ability, this is quite easy to host a set of files that retain a permanent address via the Hash. However, as with all P2P networks that have decomposed files into pieces, if some of the nodes are not online that host that data it may be inaccessible.
Download link: https://ipfs.io/#get-started 
Technical Documents (reference): https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/overview/
Download and install the IPFS Desktop environment and test hosting different types of files. Then try and access them in a browser to ensure that they are working. This technology alone provides a great way to be able to host your own storage server between different computers that you own other than traditional cloud platforms like Dropbox and OneDrive.
Note: I cover this in more detail in the ERC721 lecture.

For this week, these two videos depicting the deployment of ERC20 standard tokens and ERC721 standard NFTs also serve as the basis for your assignments this week. So before starting these lectures, briefly review the assignment to make note of specific sections, steps, commands, etc. that may be useful for your own assignment. The development and understanding of the two most basic components of most blockchain applications, tokens and NFTs, you will begin your journey down the rabbithole that is the Web3 revolution. These two simple, yet powerful, concepts are what serve as the basis for the token economy and will be critical in the development of future blockchain organizations. Understanding different uses for these standards will help you in your journey to identifying the uniqueness in other projects that attempt to innovate upon these two ideas.

Optional Video: How IPFS Deals with Files
Optional Video: How IPFS Deals with Files
This presentation from the IPFS Camp Workshop provides details on how the actual files are broken up, hashed, compared, and stored on IPFS from a technical perspective. If you are interested in the computaitons and cryptography that makes the IPFS network functional, this is a great presentation from the developers of IPFS, however they do get into the weeds and focus on much more of a computer science perspective. They showcase a series of tools that you can utilize to test different files, understand how it will get broken up, and how it gets destributed on the network. 

From a business perspective, understanding the role of IPFS at a high level is all that is needed, from a development level and to compare against other alternative decentralized file storage approaches this is a great way to understand the details.

    Required Reading: Web3 Developer Stack 2022
    Over the past 3 years, the Web3 ecosystem has absolutely exploded in opportunity and technology. The term Web3 began being used around 2018 and has become the replacement for the larger blockchain ecosystem as we begin integrating these into our traditional technology stacks. To that end, understanding the Web3 developer stack is a great place to start to identify both the types of technologies used to connect the blockchains and our applications, what types of utiltizes and resources have been developed to make things easier, and most importantly for your job search, what companies you might be interested in applying to.

    In the attached whitepaper from the Blockchain Center of Excellence, Chen Zur (EY) and Dr. Mary Lacity (UArk) discuss the emergence of the Web 3.0 landscape and the role that blockchain technologies will play in the next evolution of our Internet technologies. This whitepaper is targeted towards executives with a high level of knowledge in blockchain and provides a brief introduction to the key components of blockchain technologies, existing web technologies, and the transformation in the industry that we have currently seen (e.g. DeFi) and the future directions we anticipate in the coming years. Some of the most interesting aspects (in my opinion) are the introduction of NFTs, DeFi, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), and stable coins.
    Abstract: Since the emergence of blockchain technology in 2009, with Satoshi Nakamoto’s launch of Bitcoin as its first real-world application, there have been many claims that this technology will “change the world”. At the heart of this claim lies the notion of blockchain technology’s ability to replace the current monetary system by using the public Internet to manage the exchange of value in a peer-to-peer manner rather than through trusted middleman on private networks. In this paper, we discuss the basis for this claim and the basic tools and capabilities, including tokens and smart contracts, that make the emergence of an “Internet of Value” possible. We discuss where we are, what has already been accomplished, and the road ahead.

    This documentation for the Web3.JS framework provides and overview of the Web3.JS funcationity, showcases the specific syntax used, and a series of tutorials for getting this to work as expected in different areas such as on a server in Node.JS or via HTML in a browser application. More specifically, the web3.eth object will showcase lots of pre-built functions such as checking the balance of accounts, deploying contracts, interacting with contracts, and getting status indicators of the network. As you progress through your assignments and your group project, this will be a great resource to reference when understanding different objects you are interacting with in a sample DAPP.

    Required Video: Bildr Studio Web3 Workshop
    The Bildr Team (specifically Mark and Drew) provided an interesting Web3 Workshop this past week to describe the different trends they are seeing in the Web3 space, what tools the Bildr team has developed so far, and new ideas for iterations in the future. In this workshop they describe the different methods to "token-gating", different security levels, and different ways that you can proceed within Bildr. They also give me a small shout out for the Contract ABI tool that I'm developing to integrate within the products to make things go smoother for other developers. While we have discussed token-gating to some extent in class, and seen it in action for the Bildr studio, getting it straight fromt the team and also hearing about how some of their clients are using the feature is an interesting listen. I truely believe that this form of login and user validation will become the standard in our environment in the coming years as we all begin to "own" our user identies and data.

    Required Software: Bildr Studio
    After exploring many different no-code/low-code platforms, the one that I have found to be the most comprehensive for developers (especially in the Web3/blockchain space) is the Bildr Studio. This platform is an interesting one because they actually used the Bildr.com tool to further build the Bildr.com tool! I have been speaking with the development team at Bildr (they have a Discord and are very responsive) and have also found a way to build your own components that can later be sold on their marketplace once it is deployed. Additionally, not only can you develop your OWN projects, but you can collaborate with your teammates and others live in the system to allow collaborative development (exactly what you need for the hackathon in the Spring).
    Note: This is a newer software that was released in the last year, therefore it will change frequently, may have bugs, and the best way to resolve issues is to reach out to the instructor or to the developers directly on their Discord.

    Required Resource: No-Code List
    One of the biggest advancements in the past few years is the evolution of no-code/low-code development platforms to increase the speed of development for entreprenuers and startups. Many of these tools are used for quick prototyping, but others are complete development environments that provide some amazing features and abilities. One great resource to keep track of the newest tools available for developers is to utilize a platform like No Code List. The following link provides and overview of not only no-code UI platforms, but also lots of connectors and SaaS products (e.g. Xano, AirTable, Firebase, etc.) that can be intergrated into your projects to expand their abilities. Depending on if you are (a) developing out an idea and visuals only or (b) hoping to build a fully functional and deployed application then the specific tool that you decide to use will differ. We will explore a few of these tools for helping to design the "ideas" for you future projects, learning to utilize these to provide prototypes of your minimum viable product (MVP) will dramatically increase the outcomes of success.

    Required Tutorial: Web3 Development with Web3.JS
    **Part 1 of this week's assignment**
    In the prior weeks you reviewed the initial "Intro to Ethereum" videos to understand the syntax and development environment of Solidity. The initial way that we connected our Ethereum blockchains to the current Web environment are highlighted in these videos. This method is still the basic foundation of how all decentralized applications (DAPPs) are built today, however we are quickly seeing an explosion in new development tools for both novice and advanced developers. Understanding what these new tools are making "easier" or "faster" is only truly appreciated when you've experienced the detailed steps. Therefore, I highly recommend that you start the week by following these videos and testing the Hello World example to develop some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Solidity experience. Then, after completing your first example Web3 application using Web3.js, you will continue the week exploring some of the newer tools and utilities that are available to make this process much faster.

    **Part 2 of this Week's Assignment**
    In this tutorial (visual instead of video this time), I go through and provide some general overview of the Bildr Studio and how to create simpel webpages. There are a variety of tutorials out there for Bildr, but it's always helpful to see the same content from different perspectives depending on what your focus is. In this tutorial I walk through how to (a) import new modules and SDKs into Bildr using headers, (b) create new pages and add elements to the page, (c) create action flows and interactions with the elements on the page, (d) connect MetaMask to your web pages, and (e) create a simple HelloWorld application. More specifically, the last 30 pages of this tutorial is exactly what you will need to do for the 2nd half of the assignment from last week. This tutorial was written BEFORE I created the new Contract ABI plugin for Bildr and therefore will have you taking the code you wrote for the HTML file when you hardcoded Web3.js, and port it into Bildr for the same functionality. It will walk you through creating your own, custom action types and how to import the code needed. After attempting this process, you can then use my Contract ABI tool and will be able to realize just how much automated code is generated and how many steps a single plugin is able to solve for you.
    As you are working through this document, if you run into any issues, confusion, or questions please reach out and we can solve this collaboratively in the Team's channel.
    Note: The section discussing Moralis in the document has now be deprecated due to an update to their software. I have left the content in so that you can see conceptually how it is integrated into the document, but you do not have to work through those steps (please read them for my descriptions). In the next tutorial we will see how to use REST APIs for getting access to data instead of going directly to the blockchain with Moralis.

    Optional Software: JSONCrack
    Optional Software: JSONCrack
    One of the basic data types that we will be using heavily this semester and moving forward is JSON data. Last week you got a brief introduction to JSON if you have not explored it, but it is basically a structured data file that holds multiple objects and attributes within it (e.g. the data we created for NFTs as well as the standard data coming out of our blockchain). While reading these files in notepad or VS Code is possible, as the files continue to get bigger with more data they become a bit hard to navigate through effectively. One tool that I've been using recently to help with this is JSONCrack. This software provides you a visual representation of the information coming back in your JSON file as well as how to navigate down into it when we are utilizing it. We will go over this in more detail throughout our development journey, but bookmarking this tool will be helpful as you explore.

    Optional Reading: Web3.py A Python Framework
    Optional Reading: Web3.py A Python Framework
    While much of our work this semester will focus on Ethereum and its integration with the web stack using javascript and Web3.js, developers from across the globe are quickly porting this framework to other programming languages that developers use. One language that many of you are familiar with, or will be familiar with in your jobs, is Python. The following link provides the official documentation for the Web3.py framework which provides the same functions and features that the javascript framework does. However, in many cases a python program is running in a console (i.e. script-based development without UI) and used for automation techniques. Many of the automated cryptocurrency trading platforms that you see advertised online utilize python to scrape web data, get indicators of market movement from social media, and read directly from the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.py to get information such as movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency between wallets (e.g. the "whale" watchers on twitter).

    This is not something required or covered in class, but if you are experienced with python, or would like to build something in python for your individual project you are welcome to do so. Much of the logical steps that we will implement in our smart contracts will remain the same, while the way a user will interact with the blockchain will differ (e.g., HTML and metamask with Web3.JS compared to direct command line interaction).

    Optional Tutorials (intermediate): Intro to Web3.JS - DappUniversity
    Optional Tutorials (intermediate): Intro to Web3.JS - DappUniversity
    This set of tutorials from the DappUniversity provide a great overview and in-depth explanation of the Web3.JS framework for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. This specific tutorial showcases how to (a) download and install Node.JS on your local machine and (b) utilize the Web3.JS package inside of Node.JS (a server-based javascript compiler) to interact with the Ethereum network. However, this exact same Web3.JS framework is also utilized in HTML development for browser-based interactions that we can quickly develop inside of an IDE such as Ethereum Studio (studio.ethereum.org) without having to worry about developing and installing a complete development environment as described below.
    This set of tutorials is a great overview of the different functionality and methods that the Web3.JS package can implement, but doesn't go into how to implement them in HTML. Therefore, I recommend taking a look at the first 3 videos in the series which explain what Web3.JS is, what the Ethereum configuration looks like in a Web3.JS application, and how to interact with the Ethereum network to get information such as the prior transactions. We will then utilize these commands inside of an HTML application (instead of a Node.js application) for our Dapps. However, understanding the underlying functions and abilities of Web3.js is critical for understanding how they are connected.

Required Reading: ChatGPT Plugins
While OpenAI's ChatGPT has become the fastest growing technology adoption in history, it also spurred the ideas of many innovators to create ChatGPT wrappers and applications/companies to help do specific tasks. As ChatGPT allowed users to access GPT-4 models, which were integrated into lots of platforms such as Microsoft's Bing and soon the entire Microsoft Office package, they quickly released a new addition last week that is set to change the game of software development and companies as a whole. Specifically, they released the ability to create "plugins" for ChatGPT to integrate it directly into different data sources, technologies, and give it live access to the internet (is this a good idea?!).

Required Reading/Videos: Streamr Network (DePIN)
Another significant DePIN platform that is seeing significant growth as one of the basis for many other platforms (e.g. DIMO) is the Streamr Network. This network allows users to use their computers as data relay points, sharing data across the network that is live, real-time data from various IoT devices, existing systems, and software that is used in other applications. Think of this as being able to leverage your bandwidth on your internet to share other information instead of sharing harddrive space, CPU computations, or GPU computations. The decentralized networks are finding many different ways to utilize our computational and network resources to build stronger, more resilant networks. These networks will also be critical in fighting against censorship in the coming years by removing the ability to take down a data feed at a central location.

Additionally, they discuss how to setup email integration to send information to the user upon registration. This is one of the most basic aspects of online e-commerce and the general sales funnel for a product. You'll have a main page with the general information, ask for registration or email, and then continue to give them information via a second website and continued emails until they sign up or buy something (we've all received this daily in our personal emails). 
This specific tutorial is NOT Web3 specific, but allows us to understand how existing web applications work, and then in the tutorials for our specific class we will modify this to allow for signup via MetaMask as well as how to token-gate the pages so only existing users can access it.

Note: As you play around with the Landing Page tutorial, you might want to potentially utilize this as a starting point for your own personal portfolio project by changing the information and details about you. Think of this as your personal, online portfolio and resume in the Web3 space (www.web3devdoc.com) that people can use to find your information. We will discuss the individual project (your own portfolio), in class on Saturday for you to begin developing.

Required Reading: RESTRICT Act Overview
Over the past few weeks we have seen significant congressional attention on a potential Tiktok ban in the US, a global banking crisis, and the underhanded attack on cryptocurrencies as the US government continues to attack the fiat on-ramps for cryptocurrency companies. This week we have seen the introduction of another piece of legislation that will have significant impacts on the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, as well as our digital freedoms as well. During class we will spend some time discussing these implications as they continue to arise over the week, but in prepration please take a chance to read and research some of these bills and issues that have come to light.

White House Economic Report 2023
These two White House reports provide an indication of the current administration's views on the cryptocurrency market, and in essence claims that digital assets have zero value and are all scams. They are utilizing this perspective to push new legislation to "protect" consumers and the US economy due to the recent banking crisis that we are seeing. Take a view of these insights and see which of them you believe, trust, or relate to.

Tiktok Congressional Hearing
Some of you may have been watching the Tiktok CEO presenting to Congress during the last week, and hopefully you have all quickly realized just how uninformed our congressional leaders are in technology in general. Many of these questions come as opposition to the Chinese government directly and utilizing Tiktok as a front for these potential threats. Interestingly, US companies (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) all utilize the same or worse techniques in their applications (e.g. Cambridge Analytica scandal). Below are a few articles to help set the context for this week's discussion in class:

RESTRICT Act (Senate Bill 686)
As a claim to protect consumers from Tiktok, and mentioned in the press as the Tiktok ban bill, this bill actually has much deeper implications for censorship in the US than any bill we have seen in decades. This bill, titled Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology Act (the RESTRICT Act), is being framed as anti-Tiktok but actually is so vague and general that it could apply to many other areas of internet communication, including cryptocurrency.

Full Bill: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/text?s=1&r=15
To see the depth of implications of these bills, there are multiple legal scholars (and wanna-be conspiracy theorists as well) examining the language of this bill for what things may actually happen. Some of the biggest concerns are the potential for a $250,000 fine for accessing "banned" websites and applications using VPNs (which have become very popular in recent years) PER CLICK! 
To get a feel for some of this, just take a look through the Youtube, Twitter, or even Tiktok search feeds for the "RESTRICT Act" and see some of the insights that can be gained for this. With 150 Million US users on TikTok, a ban of this nature has never before been seen in history and puts us very close to a censorship process of many other platforms if this is to be enacted.

As we progress throughout the rest of the semester and during the Spring, I've asked some of our local OzDAO community to provide some advice, insights, and stories about their Web3 journeys into the space. We are very lucky in that the local OzDAO community is filled with individuals who have launched multiple companies within and outside of the Web3 space, many are working in large Web3 companies, and many are also navigating a journey of learning this technology much as you have. In the attached video you will find an overview of Gabriel Allred with BitLectroLabs. Dr. Allred has a very interesting background and has transitioned out of academia (psychology!) and into the Web3 space based on his passions and interests. This really highlights the fact that you do NOT have to be technical and deep in the weeds of the technology to be able to pivot your career and explore these opportunities.
