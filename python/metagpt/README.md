# MetaGPT

MetaGPT is a LLM model trainable via user-created `.txt` files. There are 3 steps to setup MetaGPT: 
1. Open either `gpt.ipynb` (gui) or `gpt.py` (terminal) and replace `<InsertAPIKeyHere>` with your OpenAI API key. 
2. Convert your desired training data to `.txt` files and upload to the `/data` directory.
3. Run the program!
