## Introduction
* The landscape of higher education has been changing dramatically since the inception of the internet. Before the introduction of the web, education and educational assets were localized, with very little instructor/student content leaving the confines of its institution of origin. These assets were primarily distributed as photocopies and were seldom distributed to other institutions. The internet allowed students, teachers and professionals from universities worldwide to begin to connect, share ideas and content and collaboratively create content. 

* Realizing that this information and the data that can be derived from it is valuable, third party companies such as Chegg, Rate my Professor, Quizlet and many others developed and launched software products to compliment and cash-in through sale of user data and increasingly expensive subscription models. Overtime, legacy education companies have begun to adopt a similar model for their institutional clients, offering a complete suite of content, worksheets, answer keys etc for universities to use in student instruction, distributed through the internet. This allowed for mass collection, aggregation and sale of student data, of which no value is passed down to the institution, students or instructors while the excessive cost of the system is carried down to students and their financial custodians. 

## Problem 
* The suite of supplemental software products that exist surrounding high education today are built to disincentivize participation and minimize compensation of the end user. As a result there is a staggering need for an improved economic structure to fairly compensate users for their contribution to a permissionless database of educational content. 

## Solution 
* Chegg3 aims to replace existing products with a web3 powered stack of educational tools and applications. These products are designed such that content is driven by students and instructors, compensated in an open, permissionless and fair way. Development of the Chegg3 product stack will be fully open source.

## Asset Hosting
* The asset hosting layer of the application serves as the database responsible for collecting, storing and organizing user-uploaded content. To ensure the immutability of these assets, the protocol will leverage a data availability network such as Arweave, Akash and Celestia. 

## Examples of EdTech Products due for Disruption
* Rate my Professor/Internal performance review systems - Student-submitted performance reviews for institutional faculty members
* Quizlet - Study material hosting platform - Students can upload datasets (Q&A) to be used for flashcards, study games, practice tests etc. 
* Chegg - Subscription based study/tutoring platform - Students can access homework/test answers, access textbooks, receive expert answers, peer review/grammar check papers. 
* Pearson - Educational publishing and assessment firm. Provides higher education coursework content and a suite of assessment tools for educators. Content is often outdated, not verified for correctness and subjective. 5 major players control what information is chosen to be published.
* National Student Clearinghouse - Educational credential verification firm. Verifies the legitimacy of personal educational credentials, typically of job applicants.

## Compensable Services 
* Course content contribution
* Submission of completed assignments 
* Answering student-uploaded questions
* Tutoring services
* Contribution of original content and study material
* Contribution of tests and practice material with corresponding answer keys
* Peer review and proofreading services
* Assessing Instructor Performance 


## Data Verification
* Aggregated from the data availability layer, all assets are converted to plain text files through OCR and database organization engines. Each asset is linked to an institution of origin, course number and instructor for organization and verification. When an asset is uploaded, it is compared against other assets with the same credentials of origin to verify its authenticity and reduce redundancy in the database.
