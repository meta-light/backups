In the past two decades, no asset has proven to be as valuable as the data that business collect.
This has thrust data security and the relatively young industry that surrounds it into important
conversations of organizational asset protection. Many similarities can be drawn between the
security and accessibility aspects of non-fungible tokens and datasets. Leveraging these
capabilities to prove ownership of datasets by use of a decentralized blockchain networks has
the potential for mass adoption in business-to-business data marketplaces.
There are many reputable blockchain networks capable of producing NFT’s containing datasets,
each with its own level of dementalization and security and solution to the blockchain
trilemma. I have Identified Ethereum, Algorand, Wax, Flow and Solana as blockchains that fit
this use case and will discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
Ethereum is known for being the original home for the NFT community, utilizing its ERC-721
token standard and IPFS asset hosting to secure the worlds most well known and actively used
blockchain with support for NFT’s. Ethereum is host to the worlds largest NFT marketplace,
Open Sea, as well. Transaction fees are paid in the blockchains native token, $ETH, and are
known for being extremely high under the current proof-of-work consensus algorithm utilized
by Ethereum. The blockchain is currently in the process of transitioning to a proof-of-stake
consensus algorithm that will eventually reduce fees by over 100 times and facilitate for
significantly more transactions per second.
Algorand is well known for being an eco-friendlier alternative to Ethereum, processing
transactions about 10 times faster while maintaining low fees and a significantly lower
ecological impact. Algorand uses a form of proof-of-stake that allows for a relatively small
amount of highly efficient and powerful validating nodes to process transactions. Algorand is
well positioned within a niche NFT community and has recently seen an increase from its
previously low adoption rate. The POS consensus algorithm used on Algorand is notably more
centralized than its competitors but is a necessary tradeoff for increased efficiency and
usability.
Wax is a younger blockchain designed to host collectibles and NFT’s in a carbon neutral manor
by utilizing very low compute power in a proof-of-stake system. Wax’s low fee structure
enables users to mint NFT’s with low value in a non-cost prohibitive manor, making it an
excellent use case for collectibles such as baseball cards. Wax transaction fees are paid in its
native token, $WAXP and contracts are written in C++. Wax is limited by its low base of users as
well as its lack of decentralization and security and has yet to become compatible with any
other blockchains for bridge transfers.
Flow blockchain is best known for its contribution to the NFT community regarding its
partnerships and high-profile collections it hosts. Flow is a simple blockchain, hosted in a more
centralized manor by validators. Flow is positioned as the blockchain built for NFT’s and hosts
collections for organizations such as the NBA and NFL. Flow makes its collections easily
accessible to users with website integrations and email wallets with no private key but trades
off levels of security that exist within other ecosystems. Flow has strong applications for
collectibles but is limited by its adoption low levels of transparency for its users and their
collections.
Solana is a proof-of-stake blockchain widely known as the current fastest blockchain in terms of
transactions processed per second. Solana is also one of the safest blockchains, promising that
a transaction fee can never exceed $0.01. Solana gained support of NFT’s recently and has seen
a massive surge in users as a result, making its popularity second to only Ethereum. Since then,
a bridge has been introduced to move assets between Ethereum and Solana, making both
ecosystems more secure as assets can exist within multiple networks. Solana’s high security and
speed come at the cost of decentration as the cost to run a Solana Validator has been set
unrealistically high for enthusiasts.
When assessing the best network to use to leverage a dataset, it is important to consider
factors that make the asset usable and secure. We must ensure that we can track the chain of
custody, ownership and authorized users assigned to a set of data while being easily able to
visualize and interpret. Of the networks described above, I believe that Ethereum is the most
viable option for organizational data asset hosting. The Ethereum network has a strong
advantage over any other NFT platform in its large user base. This support is indicative of the
strong network longevity and the highest chance of asset survival. Ethereum also has a
multitude of blockchain explorers available to view and track activity of assets, users, and
transactions. This provides it a very high level of transparency to the ownership of datasets.
Finally, Ethereum is arguably the most accessible blockchain to get started in and is the origin of
the blockchain compatible coding language, solidity, making its smart contracts compatible on
other chains with a simple copy and paste. Ethereum, however, may not always be the most
safe, fast or inexpensive blockchain, but will almost certainly offer support for migration as
users pivot to other platforms in order to have the existing NFT community follow to a new
network.
