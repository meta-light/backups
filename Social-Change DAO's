Article: ConstitutionDAO, a ‘crypto red alert’ and other cases of crypto-powered social action in 2021 via CoinTelegraph
	Many people fail to recognize the correlation between philanthropic contributions to social change and cryptocurrencies. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAO’s are a means of pooling assets from many unique parties in support of a specific purpose or cause, governed by those who have contributed to it. These organizations are ideal for nongovernmental social change causes as they can be contributed to by anybody with an internet connection and are not subject to financial regulation by local governments. DAO’s were at the center of social change movements in 2021 and helped to support many causes. One of these causes is ConststutionDAO, a DAO setup with the intent to purchase a copy of the United States constitution. The DAO was just shy of its goal due to technicalities at the auction house but was successful as a proof of concept and helped to pave the runway that has launched DAO’s into the spotlight in 2022. Personally, I believe that DAO’s have the potential to become a common means of fundraising and crowdfunding for community and social change-oriented causes and expect to see popularity and growth accelerate in the new year. I see this shift as positive for those who are limited by local regulations from supporting important causes they care deeply about. This kind of new and unorthodox orbitational structure is just beginning to be explored and has applications far beyond charitable causes.
